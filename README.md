Convolutional neural networks can be used for recognizing and categorizing wide range of image datasets. we have proposed an improved LeNet model for flower classification. This revised LeNet is an improved version of modified LeNet model in paper (Mitrovic and Milosevic, Flower classification with convolution neural network). 

This model can be used for recognizing and classifying five different types of flowers. The dataset (flower recognition) is taken from Kaggle. CNN algorithms require a lot of mathematical convolutional computations which take a lot of time and has high computational demand. GPUs can be used for accelerating image processing. Also, we can parallelize CPU cores to process images faster. Along with the implementation of the improved LeNet model, this paper also differentiates between the performance of parallelized CPUs and a GPU.
